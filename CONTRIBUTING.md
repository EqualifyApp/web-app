# Equalify Contributing Guide

Equalify is in an Alpha MVP "Wild West" phase.

The only limits are your imagination.

I know this wild west needs rules eventually.

For now, let's hack! 

## Known Quirks

**I am tuned to UX and A11Y errors.**

Fixes and reports of A11Y or UX errors are greatly appreciated.

**My many years of WP dev have trained me to follow [WordPress coding standards](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards).**

I'm up for any new coding standards!

**Every error is reported with an `Exception`.**

Exceptions allow me to log errors. 

**I consider User Errors System Errors.**

What some platforms display a warning for, like "wrong password," I ring alarm bells for.

I do this because I think good UX should be seamless.

Users should never hit roadblocks.

**There is no authorization system.**

Equalify is being designed as open as possible.

## Usable hooks and patterns. 

Checkout [/models/hooks.php](/models/hooks.php) and the `_scan` pattern in [/actions/scan_all_pages.php](/actions/scan_all_pages.php).

## Progress Depends on Bugs
I am inspired by the development of [Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg).

A community of engaged devs builds the future of WordPress around issues that are reported by users.

I hope folks, no matter their expertise, contribute to Equalify.

We can build a more accessible internet together.

Here if you need anything!
