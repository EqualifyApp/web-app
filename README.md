## Why manage WebOps in one place?
Server health affects your CMS, which affects accessibility and analytics.

Bringing WebOps data under one roof means **richer reporting** and **smarter enforcement** of your website properties.

## What is Equalify's altruistic purpose?
Making the world better is a driving force behind Equalify.

We build off of these foundational principles:
1. **Ethics take priority.** Equalify was built out of a [desire to create an ethical business](https://bbertucc.notion.site/Ethical-Business-7d8cb00d2e5f4558998450d6e38a61b6). Any ethical issue can be raised in the repo's [Issues tab](https://github.com/bbertucc/equalify/issues) and will be treated as a mission-critical bug.
2. **Code should be Open.** Open Source software inspires others to build ever greater innovations.
3. **A11Y matters.** Our product is designed around WCAG accessibility reporting and enforcement. The project aims to create a more equitable internet.
4. **Resources matter.** Efficiency promotes sustainability. Equalify is built to promote the efficiency of your WebOps. 
5. **People matter.** Collaboration is key to the project's success. The project promotes collaboration by putting people and their ideas first. Everyone is welcome to join the project!
