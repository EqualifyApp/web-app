## Why manage WebOps in one place?
WebOps needs to be integrated.

Your server's health affects your CMS, which affects accessibility and analytics.

Bringing WebOps data under one roof means **richer reporting** and **smarter management** of your website properties.

## What is Equalify's altruistic purpose?
Doing good is what motivates Equalify.

The project strives to be:
- **Ethical.** Equalify was built out of a [desire to create an ethical business](https://bbertucc.notion.site/Ethical-Business-7d8cb00d2e5f4558998450d6e38a61b6). Any issue with the project's ethics can be raised in the repo's [Issues tab](https://github.com/bbertucc/equalify/issues) and will be treated as a mission-critical bug.
- **Open.** Open Source software inspires others to build ever greater innovations.
