# Equalify the web!

**96.8% of hompages are inaccessible**, according to [WebAim](https://webaim.org/projects/million/).

That statistic is unacceptable.

Everyone should have access to the online information they want.

## How will Equalify increase accessibility?

Equalify creates deep integrations with the services that run your website. 

We will become a WebOps hub, built to solve accessibility issues.

## What does Equalify currently do?

Equalify is still in its infancy.

The app currently scans pages for WCAG errors.

Any site can be added to Equalify.

The app currently supports two integrations: [Little forrest](https://littleforest.co.uk/feature/web-accessibility/), a free WCAG 2.1 scan, and the popular [WAVE scan](https://wave.webaim.org/). 

Once you have selected your integration, you can scan all your websites.

The app reports WCAG errors as they are found.

The goal: **Equalify every website.**
