## Why manage WebOps in one place?
Server health affects your CMS, which affects accessibility that affects your analytics.

Bringing data from all WebOps services means **richer reporting** and **smarter enforcement** of your website policies.

## What's Equalify's altruistic purpose?
Making the world better is a driving force behind our work.

Three key "biases" keep our work good:
1. **Good ethics take priority.** Equalify was built out of a search a [desire to create an ethical business](https://bbertucc.notion.site/My-Ethical-Business-a55c25006c5c4b53b233df1f5c9df4da). Any ethical issue can be raised in our [Issues tab](https://github.com/bbertucc/equalify/issues) and will be treated as a mission-critical bug.
2. **Equalify is Open Source software.** Open Source software inspires others to build ever greater innovations.
3. **Equalify loves accessibility.** Our product is designed around WCAG accessibility reporting and enforcement, so we can create a more equitable internet.
