# Equalify Pro

Open Source projects like Equalify need a revenue stream to keep their work alive.

So, if we're going to make Web Accessibility better, we gotta make some dough!

## Pro Features

A managed "service" version of Equalify includes:
- Hosted Service
- Chat Support
- View-based alerting
- Enhanced notifications 
  - Send alert by alert email
  - View-based alerts
  - Bundle alerts into weekly/monthly summaries.
- Add multiple accounts to a "team"
- "Team" Management 
  - Assign alerts as "tasks" for different team members
  - Track completion of tasks

## Pro Pricing

Pricing starts at $1,400/yr for 1 team member and 10,000 annual alerts.

Add $99/yr for every new team member and $99/yr for every additional 1,000 annual alerts.

## Other Notes

Making money can cloud purpose.

The purpose of Equalify, and my life, is to do ethical good.

Here's a basic comparison of Open Source vs. Proprietary projects from [An Open Source Survey](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265411256_Open_Source_Software_A_Survey_from_10000_Feet):

It should go without saying that the values of Open Source projects are more ethical than the values of proprietary projects.

If the Pro plan is indeed designed to sustain Equalify, we must focus on that goal (and temper our desires with [basic income nest eggs](https://bbertucc.notion.site/Basic-Income-Nest-Eggs-4b555b09d02d40389086c01ec84c1424)).

Onward and upward!
