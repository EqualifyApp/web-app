# Welcome to Equalify!
Equalify is the world's first open source WebOps platform.

We aim to manage your server, accessibility, analytics, and CMS in one place. 

## Why manage WebOps in one place?
Your server health effects your accessibility, which effects your analytics.

Bringing data from all WebOps services means **richer reporting** and **smarter enforcement** of around your website policies.

## What's Equalify's altruistic purpose?
Making a positive impact is the most important driving force behind Equalify.

In addition to being an open source project, Equalify is also designed to promote accessiblity (particulaly WCAG accessibility).

All Equalify features our features around WCAG accessibility.

We believe the WCAG group is our best chance at creating an open internet. They are designing rules that give everyone access to all content on the intenet. These rules should be mandated into future code, UX, and internet infrustructure design.

Equalify will do all it can to promote WCAG accesssibility so that we can create a more open internet.
