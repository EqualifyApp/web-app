# Equalify the web!

**96.8% of home pages have WCAG conformance failures**.[^1] Failing WCAG conformance means countless people with disabilities do not have equal access to the internet.

**Equalify aims to make websites more accessible.** We are building a useful and useable platform to find and fix website accessibility issues. All of our work is open source, published under the [GNU AGPL](https://github.com/bbertucc/equalify/blob/main/LICENSE).

## What does Equalify currently do?

The app currently scans websites for  violations of the [Web Accessibility Guidlines Version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) (WCAG). 

You can import pages from WordPress, XML sitemaps, and single URLs. Equalify then crawls all your pages for WCAG 2.1 errors using the popular open-source scanning tools, like [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core).

Every alert is reported on a filterable dashboard.
