## How will Equalify increase content accessibility?

Equalify aims to:
1. **Promote transparency** with an Open Source A11Y platform (‚úÖ Done!).
2. **Reduce the cost** of multi-page website scans (ongoing).
3. **Improve automation** to simplify WCAG issue resolution (2023). 

We will tackle these goals by integrating with existing web services, making Equalify your WebOps hub.

## What does Equalify currently do?

The app currently scans websites for WCAG errors.

You can import pages from WordPress, XML sitemaps, and single URLs. Equalify then crawls all your pages for WCAG 2.1 errors using the popular [WAVE scan](https://wave.webaim.org/).

Every alert is reported on a filterable dashboard.
