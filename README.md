# Equalify the web!

**96.8% of homepages have WCAG conformance failures,** according to [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/projects/million/).

The internet must become more accessible!

To improve content accessibility, Equalify aims to:
1. **Reduce the cost** of full site, multi-page scans.
2. **Improve automation** that simplifies WCAG issue resolution.
3. **Promote transparency** to improve A11Y tools and standards.

## How will Equalify increase content accessibility?

Equalify creates deep integrations with services that run your website. 

Imagine: You solve WCAG issues at their source - be that source the server or a CMS.

Equalify will become your WebOps hub, designed to solve any accessibility issue.

## What does Equalify currently do?

The app currently scans websites for WCAG errors.

Imports pages from XML sitemaps, the WordPress API, and single URLs. Equalify then crawls all your pages for WCAG 2.1 errors using the popular [WAVE scan](https://wave.webaim.org/).

Every alert is reported on a filterabel dashboard.
