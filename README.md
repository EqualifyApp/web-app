# Equalify the web!

**96.8% of homepages are inaccessible**, according to [WebAim](https://webaim.org/projects/million/).

That statistic is unacceptable.

Everyone should have access to online information.

## How will Equalify increase accessibility?

Equalify creates deep integrations with services that run your website. 

The app will become a WebOps hub, designed to solve accessibility issues.

## What does Equalify currently do?

Equalify is in its infancy.

The app currently scans pages for WCAG errors.

Any site can be added to Equalify.

Two integrations are supported: [Little Forrest](https://littleforest.co.uk/feature/web-accessibility/), a free WCAG 2.1 scan, and the popular [WAVE scan](https://wave.webaim.org/). 

After selecting an integration, import a site.

The app supports XML sitemaps, WordPress sites, and single pages.

Click "Scan" and Equalify reports WCAG errors as they are found.

The goal: **Equalify every website.**
